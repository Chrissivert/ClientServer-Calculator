This assignment is open ended coding assignment with a room for creativity. Many students were creative in the first assignment. 
You are free to code how you want and in whichever programming language. 

Implement CPU Scheduling Algorithms 
  1)	First Come First Serve , and 
  2)	Preemptive Priority scheduling algorithm. 

User Input for First Come First Serve : Process ID, Arrival Time and Burst Time. 

User Input for Preemptive Priority Scheduling : Proces ID, Arrival time, 
Burst time, Priority. 

Output for both the algorithms: Average Waiting time: ? Average TurnAround Time: ? 

You work and discuss in groups of 4 

Deliverable: 
  1)	GitHub Link of the Code with comments 
  2)	Video showing your code in action 
  3)	A report mentioning what you learnt with the collaboration submitted by each group member.
